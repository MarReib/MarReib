## Hi there and welcome to this repo! :wave:	

My name is Martin. I am currently leading a dynamically growing Data team (*Data & Insights Team* @Oetker Digital).

My main work focus is on bringing the right people and their respective talents together to leverage value from data.
Aside of my work I try to learn, read and exchange opinions as much as I can to broaden my horizon and perspective on all kind of topics (tech- and non-tech).

## :construction_worker: I am currently working on:
- the build up and expansion of a driven data / analytics team where every team member can develop the best possible
- pitching data product ideas
- manage various ongoing data / analytics projects and product workstreams
- evaluate new opportunities for data products in the areas of analytics, applied ML & broader Data Science
